# RSS-Reader

This is a simple app to organize podcast RSS feeds on a desktop! Oftentimes if you support a podcast on a site like Patreon you recieve a private RSS link to a feed containing bonus episodes of the podcast, which is great if you're using a phone app to organize and play your podcasts but not so great if you're typically on a desktop.

There are a few example podcasts that come already in the database, but you can remove them and add your own feeds immediately!
